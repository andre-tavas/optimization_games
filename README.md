## Ideias to implement/Future steps
- Calculate and show optimal (or close to optimal) solution with solvers and metaheuristics in parallel with the players.
- Refactor the code.
- Make it easier to develop other games based on optimization problems using graphs.
- Set remaining time for ending the game once one of the player finishes.
- Enable players to choose the level (number of nodes).
